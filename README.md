# random-graphs-models
Started as a numerical task to prove convergence of number of triangles in ER graph, this project grown to consist of various random graph models' implementations, such as *Erdos-Renyi random graph, Generalized random graph, Configuration Model*.

Huge credit to the person who created the port of matplotlib to C++: https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp. matplotlibcpp.h is taken from this repository.
